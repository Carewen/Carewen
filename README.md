- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carewen (known as Carmien in the business world). My friends call me Carewen, my clients know me as Carmien (because it's complicated :)
- 👀 I've spent over 12 years as a visual developer with the Nintex Workflow/Forms stack. If you've not heard of Nintex
it's a visual workflow development tool on the SharePoint stack. 
  - My opus (so far) is a business automation system for a ~$300M company that builds multi-family
homes. This system automates most of their business and has some exciting innovations that we're really excited about. 
  - Phase 2 was launched to Sales last month, and it's the system central to their business in the following areas:
    - Land aquisition
    - Building design
    - Estimating (Pro Forma estimating, Budgeting, Pricebooks for options)
    - Sales Management and Marketing projects
    - CRM
    - Sales inventory and point of sales (supporting touchless sales in a world with COVID)
    - Automated contract builds and classification. electronic signatures and Legal closing
    - A Learned Experience Engine within task assignment
    - Integrated Six Sigma inspired measurement
    - Integrated Support, Quality Management Framework and Product R&D workflows
    - And it's a no-code solution. It's a platform...
  - If you're tempted to write off no-code, Sharepoint or visual development, I'd invite you to consider the following. As the business analyst, developer and tester,
I just used this stack to solve some real-world problems for a major local company in my market in under 18 months (during COVID). I'm the only developer, supported
by a SharePoint architect (who stood the farm up) and our Co-Founder (who purchased the hardware and added the other pieces). 
  - In other words, the age-old saying, "you don't know what you don't know" most definitely applies here!
  - That said, it was only with the release of this system that I came out from under more than a decade of "imposter syndrome",
  where because I wasn't a "software programmer" I felt I was somehow missing something, somehow less than. That's a story, and I'm a human. :)
  - This experience is going to strongly influence how I engage in expanding my development toolkit. 
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my toolkit. I've had some inspiration around some ideas for some web services. I won't get into those as yet because I've been
inspired to learn about Python and Web Development.
  - Yesterday I signed up for some Udemy courses and have few months of intense learning ahead of me.
  - However, every step of the way I'll be looking to apply what I learn with these ideas that have surfaced, a couple of which build off of over two decades of 
process improvement and business analyst experience. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python:
  - On my first day of 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 I completed two days worth. Now, it's time
to apply myself, finish the entire course, and then get into the The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp I also purchased. 
  - After that, I'll see what needs to be
learned. I expect that as I build experience I'll be guided to those tools that best support the inspiration that's in mind.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... inspiring projects when I have the experience to do so. Fow now, I'm taking two decades of experience of learning how to solve 
problems and to build out my development toolkit to realize business evolution.
