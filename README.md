- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carewen (known as Carmien in the business world). My friends call me Carewen, my clients know me as Carmien (because it's complicated :)
- I've deployed v0.5 of my first web application (and the idea that brought me to Python in the first place) at https://lanesflow.io
- I'm busy developing my second Django application. This one is super exciting...stay tuned!
- 👀 I've spent over 12 years as a visual developer with the Nintex Workflow/Forms stack. If you've not heard of Nintex
it's a visual workflow development tool on the SharePoint stack. 
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my toolkit. I've had some inspiration around some ideas for some web services. I won't get into those as yet because I've been
inspired to learn about Python and Web Development.
- 🌱 I worked my way through Python with 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021. I've got a JS bootcamp yet to do. But first, I'm building on the deployment of LanesFlow at https://lanesflow.io
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... inspiring projects when I have the experience to do so. Fow now, I'm taking two decades of experience of learning how to solve 
problems and to build out my development toolkit to realize business evolution.
