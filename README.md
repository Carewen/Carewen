As a developer I took a less common route into engineering websites with Django. I've spent over two decades in process improvement, product management and business analysis. I've worn the hats of Business Analyst, Six Sigma Master Black Belt, Process Improvement educator and mentor, Not For Profit Governance educator, Business Architect, Systems Developer and Management Consultant. And after inspiration for some intriguing business ideas came to me I realized that I'd need to learn how to develop web applications from the ground up. 

This means that my path to developing web applications includes surfacing insights that a developer-first focus may not identify. My deep experience with how organizations and teams collaborate together (process, or function) and how the tools they use (form) objectively makes a profound difference when it comes to project results. This empowers me in putting myself in both the chair of the customer and the business, which in turn realizes significant value and ROI. I'm also ProSci(r) Change Management certified which means I bring experience and expertise with helping teams and organizations navigate change.


Before discovering Django I spent over a decade as a visual developer with the SharePoint workflow foundation, specifically with the Nintex Workflow/Forms stack. My latest achievement with that stack is an information automation system used by a condominium construction company to support their land acquisition, building design, estimating and procurement processes, CRM functionality, and automated contract build and management. This system has been in production since March 2021 and is doing very well.


In 2021 I discovered Django and have become a big fan of the framework. The saying that "Django makes the easy things easy and the hard things possible" rings so very true to me. I am currently working on my third/fourth deployed projects. My focus has been on pure Django with some JS until this point, as my preference is to dive deep into a framework with the intention of mastering it. My deployment experience has focused on the Digital Ocean platform, Docker and Postgres. I'm getting very comfortable with the full breadth of Django while realizing the both the power and speed of what native Django can bring to the table.


My passion is to combine decades of problem-solving and business empowerment together with tools that help organization's realize business evolution. If you're looking for a value-first developer that has experience with facilitating strategic planning, organizational redesign, process improvement strategies to better understand value and eliminating customer pain-points then I would love to hear from you.
