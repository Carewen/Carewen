- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Carewen (known as Carmien in the business world). My friends call me Carewen, my clients know me as Carmien (because it's complicated :)
- I've deployed v0.3 of my first web application (and the idea that brought me to Python in the first place) at https://lanesflow.io
- üëÄ I've spent over 12 years as a visual developer with the Nintex Workflow/Forms stack. If you've not heard of Nintex
it's a visual workflow development tool on the SharePoint stack. 
  - My opus (so far) is a business automation system for a ~$300M company that builds multi-family
homes. This system automates most of their business and has some exciting innovations that we're really excited about. 
  - Phase 2 was launched to Sales March 2021, and it's the system central to their business in the following areas:
    - Land acquisition
    - Building design
    - Estimating (Pro Forma estimating, Budgeting, Pricebooks for options)
    - Sales Management and Marketing projects
    - CRM
    - Sales inventory and point of sales (supporting touchless sales in a world with COVID)
    - Automated contract builds and classification. electronic signatures and Legal closing
    - A Learned Experience Engine within task assignment
    - Integrated Six Sigma inspired measurement
    - Integrated Support, Quality Management Framework and Product R&D workflows
    - And it's a no-code solution, that also happens to be a platform...Which in the world of Nintex is an accomplishment we're proud of.
  - If you're tempted to write off no-code, Sharepoint or visual development, I'd invite you to consider the following. As the business analyst, developer and tester,
I just used this stack to solve some real-world problems for a major local company in my market in under 18 months (during COVID). I'm the only developer, supported
by a SharePoint architect (who stood the farm up) and our Co-Founder (who purchased the hardware and added the other pieces). 
  - In other words, the age-old saying, "you don't know what you don't know" most definitely applies here!
  - That said, it was only with the release of this system that I came out from under more than a decade of "imposter syndrome",
  where because I wasn't a "software programmer" I felt I was somehow missing something, somehow less than. That's a story, and I'm a human. :)
  - This experience is going to strongly influence how I engage in expanding my development toolkit. 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in expanding my toolkit. I've had some inspiration around some ideas for some web services. I won't get into those as yet because I've been
inspired to learn about Python and Web Development.
- üå± I worked my way through Python with 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021. I've got a JS bootcamp yet to do. But first, I'm building on the deployment of LanesFlow at https://lanesflow.io
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... inspiring projects when I have the experience to do so. Fow now, I'm taking two decades of experience of learning how to solve 
problems and to build out my development toolkit to realize business evolution.
