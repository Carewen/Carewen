- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carewen
- Started working on my first open source project - a digital library https://cosmicchrist.love
- April 2022: Deployed v1 of an exciting Event Management solution at https://whurthy.com (in beta)
- September 2021: Deployed v0.5 of my first web application (and the idea that brought me to Python in the first place) at https://lanesflow.io
- 👀 I've spent over 12 years as a visual developer with the Nintex Workflow/Forms stack. If you've not heard of Nintex
it's a visual workflow development tool on the SharePoint stack. 
- 🌱 I’m interested in expanding my toolkit. My focus is in Django.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... inspiring projects when I have the experience to do so. Fow now, I'm taking two decades of experience of learning how to solve 
problems and to build out my development toolkit to realize business evolution. Perhaps my greatest developer strength is being able to spot functionality that wasn't even considered previously.
